The default web server of the Crystal is quite good :smile: but it weak at routing :cry:.  
Kemal is an awesome defacto standard web framework for Crystal :smile:, but it's too fat for some purpose :cry:.

**router.cr** is a **minimum** but **High Performance** middleware for Crystal web server.  
See the amazing performance of **router.cr** [here](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest).:rocket:

**router.cr** also contains
 - Convenient rendering tool
 - Access profiler

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  router:
    github: tbrand/router.cr
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

```crystal
require "router"
```

Include `Router` to utilize **router.cr**.
```crystal
class WebServer
  include Router
end
```

In the following sample codes, `class WebServer ... end` will be omitted.
To initialize RouteHandler
```crystal
@route_handler = RouteHandler.new
```

To define Action, call Action.new with `context` and `params`(optional) where context is HTTP::Server::Context and params is Hash(String, String). All Actions have to return the context. In this example, params is omitted. (The usage of params is later)
```crystal
@index = Action.new do |context|
  context.response.print "Hello router.cr"
  context # returning context
end
```

Define your routes in a `draw` block.
```crystal
draw(@route_handler) do # Draw routes
  get "/", @index
end
```

To activate the routes
```crystal
def run
  server = HTTP::Server.new(3000, @route_handler) # Set RouteHandler to your server
  server.listen
end
```

Finally, run your server.
```crystal
web_server = WebServer.new
web_server.run
```

See [sample](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr/blob/master/sample/sample.cr) for details.

### Path parameters

`params` is a Hash(String, String) that is used when you define a path parameters such as `/user/:id` (`:id` is a parameters). Here is an example.
```crystal
class WebServer
  @route_handler = RouteHandler.new

  @user = Action.new do |context, params|
    context.response.print params["id"] # get :id in url from params
    context
  end

  def initialize
    draw(@route_handler) do
      get "/user/:id", @user
    end
  end
end
```

`params` also includes query params such as `/user?id=3`. Here is an example.
```crystal
class WebServer
  @route_handler = RouteHandler.new

  @user = Action.new do |context, params|
    response_body = "user: "
    # Get a query param like /user?id=3
    response_body += params["id"] if params.has_key?("id")
    context.response.print response_body
    context
  end

  def initialize
    draw(@route_handler) do
      get "/user", @user
    end
  end
end
```

See [sample](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr/blob/master/sample/sample.cr) for details.

### Rendering views(.ecr)

router.cr also support **simple rendering function** to render `.ecr` file with parameters.

First, define your view like
```crystal
def_view :view_sample, "sample/public/hello.ecr", name: String, num: Int32
```
where "sample/public/hello.ecr" is
```
My name is <%= @name %>. The number is <%= @num %>.
```
`:view_sample` is an identifier of the view. "sample/public/hello.ecr" is a relative path to the file. `name` and `num` are parameters used in "sample/public/hello.ecr". Note that these parameters have to be class variables in the file. See [here](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr/blob/master/sample/public/hello.ecr). When you render them, just call `render_view` like
```crystal
context.response.print render_view(:view_sample, "tbrand", 10)
```

See [sample](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr/blob/master/sample/sample.cr) for details.

### Get profiles

router.cr also serves **ProfileHandler**. By using this, you can easily get the access data like
```
[ GET /one ]        Access: 10          Total: 704.0µs      Ave: 70.4µs
[ GET /two ]        Access: 9           Total: 309.0µs      Ave: 34.3µs
[ GET /three ]      Access: 9           Total: 262.0µs      Ave: 29.1µs
```
For this, just set `ProfileHandler` to your server like
```
server = HTTP::Server.new(3000, [ProfileHandler.new, @route_handler])
```
After running your server, try accessing "/profile".

See [sample](https://github.com/tbrand/router.cr/blob/master/sample/profile.cr) for details.
